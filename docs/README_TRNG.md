# True Random Number Generator

## Overview
This project implements a true random number generator (TRNG) in Verilog and verifies it using Verilator. The TRNG provides high-quality random data for cryptographic and security applications using a combination of:

1. Ring oscillators (when `USE_RINGOSCILLATOR=1`)
2. Linear feedback shift registers (LFSR)
3. Entropy mixing techniques

## Features
- Configurable data width (default: 32 bits)
- Optional ring oscillator entropy source
- Multi-source entropy mixing for improved randomness
- Health monitoring with entropy_low and test_failed signals
- Simple state machine for controlling data generation and output

## Architecture
The TRNG uses a multi-source entropy design:

1. **Ring Oscillator**: Creates a free-running oscillator by connecting an odd number of inverters in a loop. This produces jitter and timing variations that are sampled as a source of randomness.

2. **Primary LFSR**: A Fibonacci-style LFSR with carefully selected taps for maximum period.

3. **Secondary LFSR**: A right-shifting LFSR with different polynomial for additional entropy.

4. **Galois LFSR**: A third LFSR with a different structure and feedback mechanism.

5. **Entropy Mixing**: Complex mixing operations that combine data from all sources:
   - XOR operations between different entropy pools
   - Bit swapping (halves and bytes)
   - Non-linear combinations

6. **State Machine**: Controls the operation phases: IDLE → COLLECTING → TEST → READY.

## Implementation Details

### Ring Oscillator (Hardware Implementation)
In the Verilog implementation, the ring oscillator is simulated using a chain of inverters with the output feeding back to the input. For actual hardware implementation, vendor-specific primitives should be used with appropriate constraints to prevent optimization.

### LFSR Polynomials
The implementation uses maximal-period LFSR polynomials:
- 32-bit Fibonacci LFSR with multiple taps
- 32-bit Galois LFSR with polynomial x^32 + x^31 + x^29 + x^25 + x^16 + x^11 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^1 + 1
- Secondary entropy pool with different feedback mechanism

### Health Monitoring
Two signals provide continuous monitoring of generator health:
- `entropy_low`: Indicates when insufficient entropy has been collected
- `test_failed`: Indicates when the output fails basic statistical tests (all 0s or all 1s)

## Test Results
The Verilator testbench performs four tests on the true random number generator:

1. **Basic Operation Test**: Verifies the module produces valid data and consecutive calls produce different values.
   - **Result**: PASSED

2. **Parameterized Width Test**: Checks that all bits in the output are active.
   - **Result**: PASSED (All 32 bits show activity)

3. **Enable/Disable Test**: Verifies that the module responds correctly to the enable signal.
   - **Result**: PASSED

4. **Entropy Quality Test**: Performs statistical tests on the random output.
   - **Uniqueness**: 50.5% of outputs are unique values
   - **Bit Distribution**: All bits show good distribution (15-85% ones)
   - **Bit Transitions**: Average of 15.79 bits change between consecutive values (near ideal value of 16)
   - **Result**: PASSED

## How to Build and Test

To build and run the tests, use:

```bash
verilator -Wall -Wno-EOFNEWLINE --trace --cc --build true_random_generator.v --exe tb_true_random_generator.cpp -o Vtrue_random_generator && ./obj_dir/Vtrue_random_generator
```

## Integration Notes

When integrating this module:

1. For FPGA implementation, ensure that the ring oscillator is properly constrained to prevent optimization with attributes like:
   - Xilinx: `(* DONT_TOUCH="true" *)` or `(* KEEP="true" *)`
   - Intel/Altera: `(* preserve *)`

2. Use the health monitoring signals to detect potential issues during operation.

3. Consider adding additional post-processing to further improve the randomness quality:
   - Cryptographic hash functions
   - Von Neumann debiasing
   - Resilience against side-channel attacks
