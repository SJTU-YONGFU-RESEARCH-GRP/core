## Introduction

Debugging and performance monitoring are critical aspects of digital design. This library provides two essential modules for system introspection:
1. A flexible Logic Analyzer for capturing and analyzing signal behavior
2. A multi-channel Performance Counter for tracking system events

These modules are designed to be highly configurable, allowing seamless integration into various digital systems.

## Logic Analyzer

### Key Features
- Configurable channel count (default: 32)
- Flexible sample depth (default: 1024)
- Multiple trigger modes
- Pre and post-trigger sample capture
- Circular buffer mechanism

### Architecture

                   |  +-------------+  |
                   +-------------------+
```

### Trigger Modes
- Equal: Trigger when signal matches specific value
- Not Equal: Trigger when signal differs from value
- Rising Edge: Trigger on signal transition from low to high
- Falling Edge: Trigger on signal transition from high to low

### Implementation Details

```verilog
// Trigger condition detection
wire equal_match = ((masked_probe & trigger_mask) == (trigger_value & trigger_mask));
wire rising_edge = ((masked_probe & trigger_mask) > (prev_masked_probe & trigger_mask));
wire falling_edge = ((masked_probe & trigger_mask) < (prev_masked_probe & trigger_mask));

always @(*) begin
    case (trigger_mode)
        2'b00: trigger_match = equal_match;     // Equal
        2'b01: trigger_match = !equal_match;    // Not Equal
        2'b10: trigger_match = rising_edge;     // Rising edge
        2'b11: trigger_match = falling_edge;    // Falling edge
    endcase
end
```

### Use Cases
- Hardware debugging
- Signal behavior analysis
- Protocol verification
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Embedded system diagnostics

## Performance Counter

### Key Features
- Configurable counter width (default: 32 bits)
- Multiple independent counters (default: 8)
- Edge-triggered counting
- Flexible event selection
- Full counter state visibility

### Architecture

                   | Performance       |
  event_inc ------>| Counter           |
                   |                   |
  counter_sel ---->|  +-------------+  |
                   |  | Counter     |  |
                   |  | Array       |  |
                   |  +-------------+  |
                   |         |         |
                   |         v         |
                   |  +-------------+  |
                   |  | Output      |  |
                   |  | Multiplexer |  |
                   |  +-------------+  |
                   +-------------------+
```

### Counting Strategies
- Rising edge detection
- Independent counter tracking
- Selective counter access
- Atomic clear and reset operations

### Implementation Details

```verilog
// Increment counters on rising edge
for (i = 0; i < COUNTER_COUNT; i = i + 1) begin
    if (event_inc[i] && !prev_event_inc[i]) begin
        counters[i] <= counters[i] + 1'b1;
    end
end
```

### Use Cases
- Instruction execution tracking
- Cycle counting
- Event frequency measurement
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Performance profiling

## Comparative Analysis

| Feature | Logic Analyzer | Performance Counter |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Purpose | Signal Capture | Event Counting |
| Trigger Complexity | High | Low |
| Sample Storage | Circular Buffer | Accumulative |
| Real-time Analysis | Partial | Full |
| Overhead | Medium | Low |

## Best Practices

1. **Logic Analyzer**:
   - Use channel masks to reduce noise
   - Select appropriate trigger modes
   - Consider sample depth based on system complexity

2. **Performance Counter**:
   - Define clear, meaningful events
   - Use edge detection to prevent multiple increments
   - Reset counters between measurement intervals

## Integration Strategies

### FPGA Integration
- Use dedicated debug cores
- Leverage built-in logic analyzer features
- Connect to external debug interfaces (JTAG)

### ASIC Considerations
- Implement as soft macros
- Use clock gating for power efficiency
- Provide flexible read interfaces

### Software Integration
- Memory-mapped register interfaces
- Interrupt-driven data collection
- Streaming trace capabilities
