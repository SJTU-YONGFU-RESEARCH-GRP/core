# RTL Debug Summary

## Fixed Modules

1. **mesh_router** - Fixed width issues in the configurable_mesh_router.v module:
   - Updated arb_ptr to use correct width with $clog2(NUM_PORTS)
   - Fixed type cast issues in idx calculation using proper width
   - Added missing newline at end of file

## Partially Fixed Modules

1. **uart_tx** - Made progress on parameterized_uart_tx.v module:
   - Fixed width issues using proper width parameters
   - Added missing newline at end of file
   - Identified issues with bit ordering for transmission
   - Added proper bit order handling for UART transmission
   - Found potential issues in testbench monitor code

## Remaining Issues

1. **uart_tx** - Still has functional issues:
   - Testbench expects bit-reversed data
   - Need to fix mismatch between module and testbench

## Working Modules

1. **configurable_fir_filter** - Both low-pass and high-pass configurations work correctly.
