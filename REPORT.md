## Notes

- Tests were run using Verilator with the build directory set to 'build'
- The standardized test summary format '==== Test Summary ====' was used to capture detailed test results
- Modules marked with 'NO TESTBENCH' need testbenches to be implemented
- Some tests may fail due to issues with the implementation, not the build system
- Timeouts indicate tests that took longer than 2 minutes to complete
- Runtime measurements include compilation and execution time
- Error messages are extracted from test output when available
